## Patterns in Java
Creating patterns in Java is a great way to practice loops and logic building. You must have used nested loops to print patterns.

Each pattern requires careful use of loops (for, while), conditional statements, and sometimes arrays. This practice helps in improving logical thinking and prepares you for coding interview.
